# Supported Types

Milease supports animation operations on most types, such as Vector3, Vector2, Color, double, float, int, bool, etc., as long as your type meets one of the following conditions:

- It is a primitive type.  
- It is a serializable struct that overloads the following operators:  
  - `Type + Type`  
  - `Type - Type`  
  - `Type * float`  

This means Milease can also add animation operations to your custom types.
