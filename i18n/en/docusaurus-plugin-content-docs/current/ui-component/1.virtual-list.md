# Virtual List

Also known as the "infinite list," this list allows you to add large-scale data without significantly affecting performance.

`MilListView` maintains an object pool of list item objects. During the `Awake` phase, it determines the size of list items, then automatically reuses the list item objects and controllers through related calculations. In other words, not every piece of data has a dedicated list item object and controller bound to it. Instead, based on the portion of the list currently visible, the data for that portion is dynamically assigned to a limited number of list item objects and controllers, which then render them in the scene.

## Virtual List Items

First, you need to implement a list item controller by extending the abstract class `MilListViewItem`, which handles the appearance logic and interaction logic of list items.

### Animation Settings

Override the list item's `Default` state (optional, defaults to empty):

```csharp
protected override IEnumerable<MilStateParameter> ConfigDefaultState()
    => MAni.States(() => 
       		...
       );
```

Override the list item's `Selected` state (optional, defaults to empty):

```csharp
protected override IEnumerable<MilStateParameter> ConfigSelectedState()
    => MAni.States(() => 
       		...
       );
```

:::info

If no UI animation is needed for the list item, both methods can simply return `null`.

:::

You can also configure the click animation of the list item by implementing the `ConfigClickAnimation` method. The configured animation will play when the list item is clicked; if not needed, return `null`.

```csharp
protected override MilInstantAnimator ConfigClickAnimation()
    =>  ...;
```

### Updating Appearance

For example, if the list item data is a `string`, implement the logic:

```csharp
public override void UpdateAppearance()
{
    if (Binding is string str)
    {
    	text.text = str;
    }
}
```

Here, `Binding` is the data currently bound to the list item, assigned by `MilListView`.

Milease also provides a control function to adjust the appearance based on the current position of the list item. The parameter `pos` ranges from $[0, 1]$, representing the relative position of the list item within the entire list.

For example, to make the text color most red at the center of the list:

```csharp
public override void AdjustAppearance(float pos)
{
	var p = 1f - Mathf.Abs(pos - 0.5f) / 0.5f;
	text.color = Color.Lerp(Color.black, Color.red, p);
}
```

### Event Handling

```csharp
// Select the current list item
public override void OnSelect(PointerEventData eventData)
{
	
}

// Initialization event
protected override void OnInitialize()
{

}

// Termination event
protected override void OnTerminate()
{

}
```

:::warning

The `Awake` and `OnDestroy` methods are occupied by `MilListViewItem`. Instead, you can write related logic in the provided `OnInitialize` and `OnTerminate` events.

:::

### Other Properties

* Index: The index of the data bound to the current list item within the `Items` of `MilListView`.  
* ParentListView: The `MilListView` to which the current list item belongs.  
* DefaultTransition: Duration of the transition to the `Default` state.  
* HoverTransition: Duration of the transition to the `Hover` and `Selected` states.  

* OnSelectEvent: You can additionally bind methods here to be called when the list item is selected.

## Setting Up the Virtual List

Since the virtual list needs to receive UI events, the `raycast` of the UI it belongs to must be enabled to respond to clicks, scrolls, and other interactions.

You can add a `MilListView` component on an Image, then create your list item objects as children of this Image (the root object of the list item must implement a concrete class derived from `MilListViewItem`).

Then, drag your list item object into the `ItemPrefab` field of the `MilListView`.

### Properties

Interaction part:

* Interactable: Whether to handle selection events. If disabled, clicking a list item will not trigger the `OnSelect` function.  
* Scrollable: Whether the list can be scrolled.  
* Mouse Scroll Sensitivity: Scroll sensitivity (also applies to mobile scrolling sensitivity).

Appearance part:

* Vertical: Whether the list layout is vertical; otherwise, it is horizontal.  
* Spacing: The spacing between list items.  
* Start Padding: Distance from the first list item to the list boundary.  
* End Padding: Distance from the last list item to the list boundary.  
* Indentation: Indentation size of list items.  
* Align: Alignment of list items.

Extended options:

* LoopList: Whether to enable the "looping list". When enabled, the last item connects to the first, allowing infinite scrolling.  
* Scrollbar: The scrollbar component of the list.

Events:

* OnScrollDone: Triggered when scrolling ends.

## Using the Virtual List

### Data Operations

Add data to the virtual list:

```csharp
listView.Add(obj);
```

The data can be of any type; it will be automatically assigned to a `MilListViewItem`, i.e., the `Binding` property you encounter when implementing `MilListViewItem`.

Remove data from the virtual list:

```csharp
listView.Remove(index);
// or
listView.Remove(obj);
```

Clear the data in the virtual list:

```csharp
listView.Clear();
```

Update a specific item’s data:

```csharp
// Replace the data at index with obj and update the item's appearance
listView.UpdateItem(index, obj);
```

:::info

Performing add, remove, or update operations on the list data within the `OnSelect` event works properly. You can even delete the currently selected list item data.

:::

### Interaction

Select a specific list item:

```csharp
// This will trigger the corresponding OnSelect event
listView.Select(index);
// If you want to trigger the OnSelect event, then
listView.Select(index, true);
```

Scroll to the top of the list:

```csharp
listView.SlideToTop();
// To skip the scroll animation and jump instantly:
listView.SlideToTop(true);
```

Scroll to the bottom of the list:

```csharp
listView.SlideToBottom();
// To skip the scroll animation and jump instantly:
listView.SlideToBottom(true);
```

Scroll to a specified position:

```csharp
listView.SlideTo(position);
// To skip the scroll animation and jump instantly:
listView.SlideTo(position, true);
```

Get the position of a specified list item (for scrolling):

```csharp
listView.GetItemPosition(index);
```

### Others

Immediately refresh all list item appearances:

```csharp
listView.RefreshItemAppearance();
```

Get the instances of currently displayed list items (`MilListViewItem`):

```csharp
listView.GetDisplayingItems();
```

## Notes

:::warning

* MilListView only supports list items with fixed size along the target dimension. For example, if your list is vertical, the height of list items must be fixed; if horizontal, the width must be fixed.  
* MilListView determines the size of list items during the `Awake` phase for subsequent calculations. Therefore, you should ensure the item size is correct at that moment.  
* For looping lists, MilListView currently only works properly when the number of visible items is greater than the total number of list items.  
* Because data is dynamically assigned to `MilListViewItem`, the same instance of `MilListViewItem` does not necessarily control the same data — the `Binding` and `Index` of a `MilListViewItem` instance can change dynamically.
