# Describing States

In Milease, you can switch between two states using the MilStateAnimator, which will apply transition animations.

## Describing States with Boolean Expressions

The syntax is as follows:

```csharp
MAni.States(() => 
	obj.member == val && 
	obj.member == val && 
	...
);
```

For example, if we need to describe a state where:

* The background color is white
* The text color is black
* The letter spacing is 5f

It can be written as:

```csharp
MAni.States(() => 
	background.color == Color.white &&
	text.color == Color.black &&
	text.characterSpacing == 5f &&
);
```

By default, the animator will use `Quad` `In` easing for the transition. If you want to use other easing functions, you need to write it like this:

```csharp
MAni.States(() => 
    // highlight-start
	(obj.member == val || MAni.Ease(easeFunction, easeType)) && 
    // highlight-end
	obj.member == val && 
	...
);
```

For example, if we want to describe a state where:

* The background color is white (using `Back` `In` easing)
* The text color is black (using `Cubic` `Out` easing)
* The letter spacing is 5f (using `Quad` `In` easing)

It can be written as:

```csharp
MAni.States(() => 
	(background.color == Color.white || MAni.Ease(EaseFunction.Back, EaseType.In)) &&
	(text.color == Color.black || MAni.Ease(EaseFunction.Cubic, EaseType.Out)) &&
	text.characterSpacing == 5f &&
);
```

### How does this work?

The passed boolean expression is parsed as an `Expression<Func<bool>>`. By continuously expanding expression nodes and using reflection, related members and target values are obtained.

## Describing Substates with Extension Methods

Besides using boolean expressions to construct states, you can also construct them using extension methods on `object` types:

```csharp
object.MilState(x => x.member, value, [easeFunction], [easeType]);
```

The first parameter is similar to the basic animation description method; it is a member selector used to specify the member.

Using the same example to describe a state where:

* The background color is white
* The text color is black
* The letter spacing is 5f

You can write it as:

```csharp
new []{
	background.MilState(x => x.color, Color.white),
	text.MilState(x => x.color, Color.black),
	text.MilState(x => x.characterSpacing, 5f),
};
```

Similarly, if you want to customize easing types:

* The background color is white (using `Back` `In` easing)
* The text color is black (using `Cubic` `Out` easing)
* The letter spacing is 5f (using `Quad` `In` easing)

You can write it as:

```csharp
new []{
	background.MilState(x => x.color, Color.white, EaseFunction.Back),
	text.MilState(x => x.color, Color.black, EaseFunction.Cubic, EaseType.Out),
	text.MilState(x => x.characterSpacing, 5f),
};
```
