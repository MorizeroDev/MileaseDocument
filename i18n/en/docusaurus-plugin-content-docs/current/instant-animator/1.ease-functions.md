# Easing Functions

Milease supports the following types of easing functions:

```csharp title="EaseEnum.cs"
public enum EaseFunction
{
    Linear, Sine, Quad, Cubic, Quart, Quint, Expo, Circ, Back, Elastic, Bounce, Bezier
}
```

The supported easing types are:

```csharp title="EaseEnum.cs"
public enum EaseType
{
    In,     // Starts slow and speeds up
    Out,    // Starts fast and slows down
    IO      // Starts slow, speeds up, then slows down again
}
```

## What Is Easing?

Simply put, easing controls the speed variations during each small segment of an animation.

## Why Do We Need Easing?

Take a simple example — if you try to pull out a drawer at a constant speed, it feels stiff and mechanical.

In reality, when we pull out a drawer, the speed changes over time — it starts fast, then gradually slows down and stops.

Easing adds this natural dynamic feel to what would otherwise be uniform motion, making animations more lively and realistic.

`Linear` easing, which moves at a constant speed, is the stiffest and least natural form of movement — it's generally better to avoid it.

## The Mathematics Behind Easing Functions

Assume a car moves along the x-axis from point $ (a, 0) $ to $ (b, 0) $ over the time interval $ t_1 $ to $ t_2 $.

At any time $ t $ such that $ t_1 \leq t \leq t_2 $, the position of the car can be described as:

$$
x(t) = a + (b - a) \cdot p
$$

Here, $ p $ represents the progress ratio relative to the entire movement, defined as:

$$
p = \frac{t - t_1}{t_2 - t_1}
$$

To achieve non-linear motion (i.e., easing), we introduce an easing function $ e(p) $. The motion equation becomes:

$$
x(t) = a + (b - a) \cdot e(p)
$$

The domain of $ e(p) $ is typically $ [0, 1] $, and its range is also generally constrained to $ [0, 1] $, although certain types (like `Back`) may slightly exceed this to simulate physical effects like "overshoot" or "rebound."

Examples of common easing functions:

- Linear easing:

  $$
  e(p) = p
  $$

- In-Sine easing:

  $$
  e(p) = \sin\left(\frac{p \cdot \pi}{2}\right)
  $$

Different easing functions can simulate acceleration, deceleration, bouncing, overshooting, and other natural motion effects. They are essential tools in designing animation curves.
