# Custom Animation Handler Function

In addition to relying on Milease to compute animation operations, you can insert a **custom** animation handler function at any point:

```csharp
text.Milease((e) =>
{
	e.Target.text = $"Current animation progress: {e.Progress:P}...";
}, [resetFunction], [duration], [offset], [easeFunction], [easeType])
```

Milease will process the animation progress using the provided `easeFunction` and `easeType`, and then pass it to your custom handler function.

The custom handler function receives a `MilHandleFunctionArgs` context, which includes:

* `Progress`: Animation progress (0â€“1)
* `Target`: The target object specified when constructing the animation
* `Animation`: Additional animation-related information
* `Animator`: The associated animation controller

:::info

* During a reset operation, the custom handler function will invoke the `resetFunction`. You must implement the reset logic within this function. If `null` is passed, no operation will be performed during reset.

* If you need to use the same `handleFunction` for a specific class of objects or properties, refer to [Custom Converters](../experimental/0.transformation.md).
