# Animation Blending Modes

You may have already noticed that in the basic animation syntax introduced in the first section, there is still one parameter left unexplained:

```csharp
[offset] + [duration] / object.MQuad(x => x.member, startValue, endValue) - [blendingMode];
```

The final `blendingMode` parameter. By default, the animation blending mode is set to `Default`.

## Additive Blending Mode

When using this blending mode, the animation's start and end values will be added on top of the **current property value** of the target object during playback.

For example: if the ball’s current position is `(2,3,3)`, and you apply an animation from `(0,0,0)` to `(6,6,6)`:

* Under the default `Default` blending mode, the ball will move from `(0,0,0)` to `(6,6,6)`.

* But when using `Additive` blending mode, the ball will move from `(2,3,3)` to `(8,9,9)`.

Here's how it looks using the default blending mode:

```csharp
0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one * 6f);
```

And here's the `Additive` blending mode version:

```csharp
0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one * 6f) - BlendingMode.Additive;
```

:::warning

* Animations using the `Additive` blending mode **must** have a defined start value.
* When resetting, animations with `Additive` blending can only revert to the recorded property values at the **initial playback time**, ignoring the animator’s reset mode settings.
