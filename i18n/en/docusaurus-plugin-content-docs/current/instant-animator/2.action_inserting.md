# Events

## Key Events

Milease allows you to insert `Action`s into animations, making them more flexible.

The syntax is as follows:

```csharp
[offset] + Action.AsMileaseKeyEvent()
```

Let’s revisit the previous example and make a small modification:

* The ball fades in from transparent to white
* While the ball is changing color, the music volume fades from 0 to 1
* Once the above animations complete, the ball starts to move
* **Log "The ball has started moving!" — (this is the inserted action)**
* While the ball is moving, it scales up
* Once the above animations complete, the following actions occur in sequence: the camera's `fov` decreases, and the camera rotates

Then the code can be modified as:

```csharp
MAni.Make(
	1f / ballSpriteRender.MQuad(x => x.color, Color.clear, Color.white),
	1f / music.MQuad(x => x.volume, 0f, 1f)
).Then(
	// highlight-start
	new Action(() => {
		Debug.Log("The ball has started moving!");
	}).AsMileaseKeyEvent(),
	// highlight-end
	2f / ballTransform.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one * 3f),
	1f + 0.5f / ballTransform.MQuad(x => x.localScale, Vector3.one, Vector3.one * 2f)
).ThenOneByOne(
	1f / camera.MQuad(x => x.fieldOfView, 6f, 4.5f),
	1f / camera.MQuad(x => x.localEulerAngles, Vector3.zero, new Vector3(0, 0, 20f))
).Play();
```

This will log "The ball has started moving!" right when the ball starts to move. Of course, you can also specify a delay for the action, like so:

```csharp
MAni.Make(
	1f / ballSpriteRender.MQuad(x => x.color, Color.clear, Color.white),
	1f / music.MQuad(x => x.volume, 0f, 1f)
).Then(
	// highlight-start
	0.5f + new Action(() => {
		Debug.Log("The ball has started moving!");
	}).AsMileaseKeyEvent(),
	// highlight-end
	2f / ballTransform.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one * 3f),
	1f + 0.5f / ballTransform.MQuad(x => x.localScale, Vector3.one, Vector3.one * 2f)
).ThenOneByOne(
	1f / camera.MQuad(x => x.fieldOfView, 6f, 4.5f),
	1f / camera.MQuad(x => x.localEulerAngles, Vector3.zero, new Vector3(0, 0, 20f))
).Play();
```

:::info

If the delay time for the key event **exceeds** the maximum duration of the current animation group, it is still valid. In this case, the next animation group will wait until this key event is triggered before starting.

:::

## Animation Completion Event

Additionally, you can pass a delegate to the `Play` function, which will be called once the animation finishes playing.

```csharp
MAni.Make(
	...
).Play(() => {
	Debug.Log("Animation completed!");
});
```

:::info

* If the animation is set to loop, this delegate will be invoked multiple times — once at the end of each cycle.
* If the same animation is played **again before the current one finishes**, its progress will reset and the new delegate will replace the previous one, meaning the old one will never be called.
