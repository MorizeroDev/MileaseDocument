# Describing Animations

Milease provides a series of extension functions for `object`, with function names following the format: `M<EasingFunctionName><EasingTypeName>`.

For example, a commonly used easing function is `Quad`, and if you use the `Out` easing type, the function name would be `MQuadOut`.

Notably, when the easing type is `In`, the function name only reflects the easing function itself, such as `MQuad`.

For more information on easing functions and types, refer to other articles.

## Constructing an Animator for Any Member

```csharp
[offset] + [duration] / object.MQuad(x => x.member, startValue, endValue) - [blendingMode];
```

This is the basic statement to describe an animation. Here, `offset` (delay), `duration`, and `blendingMode` are optional parameters.

Here's a simple example: suppose we want to gradually increase the `AudioSource` volume from 0 to 1 over 0.5 seconds:

```csharp
0.5f / MyAudioSource.MQuad(x => x.volume, 0f, 1f);
```

This line describes the animation operation. The first parameter is a `MemberExpression` used to select which member of the object `MyAudioSource` to operate on.

Likewise, to move the object `ball` from one point to another after 1 second, taking 0.5 seconds to do so:

```csharp
1f + 0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one);
```

**Then, you can play the animation using any of the following methods:**

1. Call the `Play` function on the generated animator to insert it into the animation task list, which will play starting the next frame:

```csharp
(1f + 0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one)).Play();
```

2. If you need the properties to be updated immediately upon playing, use:

```csharp
(1f + 0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one)).PlayImmidiate();
```

3. If the above one-liner feels too long, you can also write:

```csharp
MAni.Make(
	1f + 0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one)
).Play();
```

## Nested Animations

Each animation statement returns a `MilInstantAnimator`. Through its fluent interface, animations can be combined and nested.

For example, consider this sequence of animations:

* The ball gradually changes from transparent to white.
* While the ball is changing color, the music volume fades in from 0 to 1.
* Once both operations are complete, the ball moves.
* Midway through the movement, the ball scales up.
* After all of the above, perform these in sequence: the camera's `fov` decreases, and the camera rotates.

You could nest them like this:

```csharp title="example.cs"
MAni.Make(
	1f / ballSpriteRender.MQuad(x => x.color, Color.clear, Color.white),
	1f / music.MQuad(x => x.volume, 0f, 1f)
).Then(
	2f / ballTransform.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero, Vector3.one * 3f),
	1f + 0.5f / ballTransform.MQuad(x => x.localScale, Vector3.one, Vector3.one * 2f)
).ThenOneByOne(
	1f / camera.MQuad(x => x.fieldOfView, 6f, 4.5f),
	1f / camera.MQuad(x => x.localEulerAngles, Vector3.zero, new Vector3(0, 0, 20f))
).Play();
```

The `Then` method means the next group of animations will execute **in parallel**, but only after all previous animations have completed. The `ThenOneByOne` method means the next animations will execute **sequentially**, again after previous ones finish.

There's also a method called `And`, not shown in the example, which means the animations that follow will **run in parallel** with the previous group.

This structure mirrors natural language logic. For example:

> The ball appeared and the music started, then the ball moved and got bigger, then the camera approached, then the camera rotated.

:::warning

`MilInstantAnimator` is a reference type. This means you can append new animation content to it later. However, this is not recommended — modifying an animator while it’s playing is undefined behavior. It may also increase your project’s maintenance burden.

## Animations Without Start Values

At this point, you might wonder: if we want to animate the ball from its current position to a target, is the previous syntax too verbose?

That’s where a new animation description method comes in:

```csharp
[offset] + [duration] / object.MQuad(x => x.member, targetValue.ToThis());
```

For example, if the ball’s current position is random, but we want it to move to (0, 0, 0):

```csharp
(0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.position, Vector3.zero.ToThis())).Play();
```

Or if the ball’s current color is random, but we want it to become fully transparent:

```csharp
(0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.color, Color.clear.ToThis())).Play();
```

:::info

Though this may seem equivalent to:

```csharp
(0.5f / ball.MQuad(x => x.position, ball.position, Vector3.zero)).Play();
```

Using that version requires reconstructing the animator repeatedly. In contrast, using `ToThis()` allows the animator to be reused continuously.
